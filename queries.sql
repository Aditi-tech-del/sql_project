(3, 2, 1, 'Fender designs, redesigns, reintroductions, etc. Simply put, the American Performer Precision really impressed. Granted, the bass is not a true P, but the tonal options would make it appeal to just about anyone. If I had to choose one thing that made this bass special, it would be the neck, because it was such a true joy to play. A close second would be the aforementioned tonal variations that are suitable for a lot of different music. This bass was built for everything under the sun, and for a U.S.-crafted instrument with this attention to detail and playability, you would be hard-pressed to spend the same money elsewhere and get the same results.', 4.7, 48, 3),

I pick it up far more often than my Gibson Les Paul. One reason is that being a hollow body I can practice without having to plug it in to my amp. It is a joy to play, it is light, it has a tone which has the beautiful airy quality of a hollow body but with the P90s it can sound really fat. I do not have problems with feedback, but then I only play at home, so it is not like I am gigging it in front of a Marshall stack. People who do experience feedback when gigging them stuff rags in the f holes. There are no quality issues with mine, it is a beautiful and well-made instrument.', 4.1, 5, 1);
